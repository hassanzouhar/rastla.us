## About Me

Hi, I'm Hassan Zouhar.

I build technology that works, teams that thrive, and strategies that last. My passion lies at the intersection of **people**, **technology**, and the creative **chaos** that often comes with innovation â€“ usually in that order.

With over [Number] years of experience in the tech industry, I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects, from large-scale cloud infrastructure to intricate real-time systems and user-facing applications. My focus is always on delivering value, whether that's through elegant code, efficient processes, or empowering the people I work with.

**Core Beliefs:**

*   Technology should *serve* people and solve real problems.
*   Great teams are built on trust, collaboration, and continuous learning.
*   Embracing complexity and ambiguity is key to innovation.
*   Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication (thanks, Leo!).

**Technical Landscape:**

While I'm always learning, my core expertise revolves around:

*   **Backend:** Go, Python, Node.js, Scala, Java
*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vanilla JS, HTML/CSS
*   **Cloud & DevOps:** Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, AWS, GCP, CI/CD, Observability (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)
*   **Databases:** PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, MongoDB, Kafka
*   **Architecture:** Microservices, Event-Driven Systems, Domain-Driven Design

**Beyond the Code:**

When I'm not immersed in technology, you might find me [Your Hobby 1, e.g., exploring hiking trails], [Your Hobby 2, e.g., experimenting in the kitchen], or [Your Hobby 3, e.g., reading about behavioral economics].
