## About Me

Hi, I'm Hassan Zouhar.

I build technology that works, teams that thrive, and strategies that last. My passion lies at the intersection of **people**, **technology**, and the creative **chaos** that often comes with innovation â€“ usually in that order.

With nearly two decades of experience in the tech industry, I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects, from enterprise infrastructure to e-commerce platforms and maritime SaaS solutions. As a former CTO at PetXL and Seaber, I've led technological transformations and built teams that deliver real value. My focus is always on combining human insight with technical expertise to create solutions that matter.

**Core Beliefs:**

*   Technology should *serve* people and solve real problems.
*   Great teams are built on trust, collaboration, and continuous learning.
*   Embracing complexity and ambiguity is key to innovation.
*   Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication (thanks, Leo!).

**Technical Landscape:**

While I'm always learning, my core expertise revolves around:

*   **Leadership:** Technology strategy, Digital transformation, Team building, Product ownership
*   **Systems:** ERP implementations, E-commerce platforms, Enterprise architecture, Cloud migration
*   **Infrastructure:** Virtualization (VMware, Hyper-V), Windows/Linux servers, Network security
*   **Development:** System integration, Automation, API design, Multi-agent systems
*   **Data:** Analytics, Reporting, Business intelligence, Data-driven decision making

**Beyond the Code:**

When I'm not immersed in technology, you might find me coaching youth football (I hold an NFF Trener 1 certification), experimenting with multi-agent AI systems, or contributing to the tech community through mentoring and writing.
