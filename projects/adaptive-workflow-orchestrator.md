# Concept: Adaptive Workflow Orchestrator

## Project Goal

To design and conceptually prototype a system capable of orchestrating complex, multi-step workflows where the steps and parameters can adapt dynamically based on real-time data and predictive insights. The aim is to move beyond static DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) towards more intelligent and resilient automation.

## Core Concept

The system revolves around a collection of specialized **agents**:

1.  **Monitor Agents:** Continuously ingest data from various sources (e.g., system metrics, event streams, external APIs).
2.  **Analyzer/Predictor Agents:** Process monitored data, identify trends, predict future states, or classify situations using ML models (potentially neural networks for complex patterns).
3.  **Planner Agent:** Maintains the high-level workflow goal. Based on input from Analyzer agents, it determines the next logical step or adjusts the overall plan.
4.  **Executor Agents:** Perform specific actions (e.g., call an API, run a script, update a database). They receive instructions from the Planner.
5.  **Coordinator (Implicit/Explicit):** Manages communication, state sharing (potentially via a shared knowledge base or message queue), and error handling between agents.

**Example Scenario:** A data processing pipeline that automatically scales resources (Executor Agent) based on predicted load (Analyzer Agent analyzing queue length from Monitor Agent), or reroutes data through a different validation step (Planner decision) if data quality issues are detected (Analyzer Agent).

## Potential Technologies (Conceptual)

*   **Core Logic:** Python
*   **Agent Framework/Communication:** `Celery` (for task queuing), `FastAPI` (for agent APIs), potentially exploring `Temporal.io` or similar workflow engines.
*   **State Management:** Redis, a dedicated database, or a vector database for semantic state.
*   **ML Models:** Standard libraries (Scikit-learn, PyTorch/TensorFlow) depending on the analysis task.

## Challenges

*   Robust state management in a distributed system.
*   Ensuring reliable communication and error handling between agents.
*   Designing effective prediction models for workflow adaptation.
*   Observability: Tracking and debugging agent interactions.
*   Avoiding overly complex or chaotic emergent behavior.

## Current Status

*   Conceptual design phase.
*   Exploring relevant orchestration tools and state management patterns.
*   Defining specific use cases for initial prototyping.
