## Universal Access to Artificial Intelligence

In 2022 neural networks went from abstract to commercial products and saw widespread adoption unlike anything we have seen before. But in the wake of this proliferation of a new and powerfull technology lingers a important question: Will this technology be available to everyone, or only those who can afford it?

In my quest for an answer to this question I look at the tools that are becoming more available now to run LLMs locally on your computer without needing to pay for access etc. I examine their quality, hardware requirements, and possible use cases.
