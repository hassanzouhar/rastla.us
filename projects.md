Here are a few selected projects I've worked on. Feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/hassanzouhar) for more!

## Project Alpha: Cloud Orchestration Platform

**Goal:** To build a scalable and resilient platform for managing containerized applications across multiple cloud providers.

**My Role:** Lead Engineer & Architect.

**Key Technologies:** Go, Kubernetes, Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, AWS, GCP.

**Description:** This project involved designing the core architecture, leading a team of 5 engineers, and implementing key features like automated scaling, self-healing infrastructure, and a unified API layer. We focused heavily on **observability** and **developer experience**. It reduced deployment times by *80%* and improved system uptime significantly.

## Project Beta: Real-time Data Analytics Engine

**Goal:** Develop an engine capable of processing and analyzing high-volume streaming data for immediate insights.

**My Role:** Senior Software Engineer.

**Key Technologies:** Scala, Akka Streams, Kafka, Apache Flink, ClickHouse, Python.

**Description:** I contributed to the core stream processing logic using Akka Streams and Flink, developed data ingestion pipelines from Kafka, and built APIs for querying results stored in ClickHouse. The system processes millions of events per second, providing valuable real-time dashboards for business intelligence. This involved complex state management and performance tuning.

## Project Gamma: Team Collaboration Tool

**Goal:** Create a user-friendly web application to improve internal team communication and project tracking.

**My Role:** Full-Stack Developer.

**Key Technologies:** Node.js, React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, Docker.

**Description:** Built both the backend API using Node.js/GraphQL and the frontend interface with React/TypeScript. Focused on creating an intuitive user interface and ensuring data consistency. Implemented features like task management, real-time chat updates (using WebSockets), and integration with existing authentication systems. This project emphasized **clean code** and **test-driven development**.
