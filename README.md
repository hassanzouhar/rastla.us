# Dynamic Neural Network Landing Page

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

A visually captivating, single-file HTML landing page featuring a complex, dynamic neural network simulation as a background. Designed to be lightweight and easy to deploy, using only the `tsParticles` library loaded via CDN.

This specific version is personalized for **Hassan Zouhar**, showcasing a name/logo with a terminal-style blinking cursor, a descriptive subtitle in Norwegian, and social media profile links.

<!-- Add a GIF or Screenshot here! It's highly recommended for visual projects. -->
<!-- Example: ![Landing Page Preview](preview.gif) -->

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Single File Deployment:** The entire project (HTML, CSS, JS) is contained within a single `.html` file for ultimate portability.
*   **Complex Background Simulation:** Uses `tsParticles` to generate an animated background mimicking neural pathways:
    *   **Node Lifecycles:** Particles (nodes) fade in and out, simulating creation and decay.
    *   **Dynamic Links:** Connections appear and disappear based on node proximity and opacity.
    *   **Clustering:** Subtle attraction forces create denser regions, mimicking neural clusters.
    *   **Interactive Signal:** Hovering over the canvas creates a bright, high-opacity link to the cursor ("grab" mode), simulating signal propagation.
    *   **Subtle Flow:** A slight directional bias adds a dynamic flow to the particle movement.
*   **Centered Content:** Logo text, subtitle, and social icons are perfectly centered vertically and horizontally using CSS Flexbox.
*   **Personalized Branding:** Includes the logo `> hassanzouhar _` with a blinking cursor effect.
*   **Social Media Links:** Integrated SVG icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Mastodon (easily expandable).
*   **Responsive Design:** Basic responsiveness ensures usability on different screen sizes.
*   **Minimal Dependencies:** Relies solely on the `tsParticles` library loaded via CDN ‚Äì no build process required.
*   **Performance Aware:** Includes `fpsLimit` and `detectRetina` settings in the particle configuration. Link triangles can be disabled for further optimization if needed.

## üöÄ Technology Stack

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3:** Modern CSS features including Flexbox, Animations (`@keyframes`), Gradients.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For particle simulation initialization.
*   **[tsParticles](https://github.com/matteobruni/tsparticles):** The single JavaScript library used for the particle animation (version `2.12.0` as per the CDN link).

## üîß Getting Started / Usage

1.  **Save the Code:** Copy the entire HTML code provided and save it as an `.html` file (e.g., `index.html`).
2.  **Open in Browser:** Double-click the saved HTML file, or open it using your web browser's "File > Open" menu.

That's it! The landing page should load with the dynamic background and centered content.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

Editing this single-file project is straightforward:

1.  **Text Content:**
    *   **Logo:** Modify the text inside the `<h1 class="logo">...</h1>` tag. The `<span class="cursor">_</span>` creates the blinking cursor.
    *   **Subtitle:** Change the text within the `<p class="subtitle">...</p>` tag.

2.  **Social Icons:**
    *   Locate the `<div class="social-icons">...</div>` section.
    *   **Update Links:** Replace the `#` placeholder in the `href="..."` attribute of each `<a>` tag with your actual profile URLs. Remember to update the Mastodon link with your instance URL as well.
    *   **Add/Remove Icons:**
        *   To remove an icon, delete its corresponding `<a>...</a>` block.
        *   To add an icon, copy an existing `<a>...</a>` block, update the `href`, `aria-label`, and replace the `<svg>...</svg>` content with the SVG code for the desired icon (you can find free SVG icons online from sources like Simple Icons, Feather Icons, etc.). Ensure the new SVG has `fill="currentColor"` if you want it to inherit the link color. Limit to ~5 icons for clean layout.

3.  **Particle Simulation (`tsParticles` Config):**
    *   Find the `<script>...</script>` block at the end of the `<body>`.
    *   The `const particlesConfig = { ... };` object contains all the settings for the background animation.
    *   **Key areas to tweak:**
        *   `particles.number.value`: Number of nodes.
        *   `particles.color.value`: Array of node colors.
        *   `particles.opacity`: Controls node fading (lifespan).
        *   `particles.size`: Node size and animation.
        *   `particles.links`: Settings for connections (distance, opacity, color, width). Toggle `triangles.enable` for performance.
        *   `particles.move`: Speed, direction (`"bottom-right"` currently), attraction (`attract.rotate` controls strength).
        *   `interactivity.modes.grab.links`: Opacity and color of the link drawn to the cursor on hover.
    *   **Caution:** Modifying these settings can significantly impact appearance and performance. Refer to the [tsParticles Documentation](https://particles.js.org/docs/index.html) (note: link points to successor documentation, concepts are similar) for detailed options.

4.  **Styling (CSS):**
    *   All styles are within the `<style>...</style>` block in the `<head>`.
    *   Change fonts (`font-family`), colors (`color`, `background`), text shadows (`text-shadow`), gradients (`background: radial-gradient(...)`), icon sizes, etc. here.
